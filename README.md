# Scene-Sense
Scene Sense is an AI-powered search engine gallery app that revolutionizes the way users interact with their photo collections. 
With Scene Sense, finding the perfect photo becomes a breeze as users can search using natural language queries.

>**Note:** This is a proof of concept and is not intended for production use.

## Inspiration
I was inspired by the idea of using AI to help users find photos in their gallery. I wanted to create a search engine that would allow users to search for photos based on the scene in the photo and be descriptive.

## To-Do
1. Wait for image embeddings to be generated before showing the image in the gallery.
